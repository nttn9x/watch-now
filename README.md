**Have a nice day 🏋️ 🏃**

Based on [React.dev](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#nextjs) we've decided to apply [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) because of [this](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why).

After reviewing the requirements, we choose [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the web's layout. Event if it is a small app, tailwindcss can hit with big applications.

All my-years-working, I always prefer to write my own libraries. That's why I do not use any UI frameworks. Because of the deadline, I have to install some lightweight libraries but It is being used through the abstraction (SOLID Principle).

Use [Vitest.dev](https://vitest.dev/) for the testing which is one thing of Vite. Nothing better than the family.
